This repo is for my super-cool personal website.


*The base code was taken from [RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio). **Several** modifications have been made since then (check out [subhalingamd/portfolio-old](https://github.com/subhalingamd/portfolio-old/) too for the initial developments).*


Contributions are welcome :)
